• Why React:

1. React is compossable: can create easily reusable and interchangable pieces of the web taht can be combined in varuis ways to create complex systems
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger or greater than the individual pieces themselves.
2. React is Declarative (what should be done): can lean on the libray to handle the manual tedeuos tasks that we otherwise would have to worry about ourselves

*Imperative* means we need to give specific step-by-step instructions on how to
accomplish a task.
*Declarative* means we can write our code to simply "describe" *what* should show up
on the page and allow the rool (React, e.g.) to handle the details on *how* to 
put those things on the page.

N.B : certain files need to be imported unto a page for them to work, e.g. the css files
React has its own bootstrap library: reactstrap or react-bootstrap

• House keeping:
1. make sure any file no matter the level of JSX is named with .JSX
2. If images are not working its probably because u havent called it from the corect directory
3. U can only render ONE jsx element at a time but that element can have as many childern as u want
4. if image satting does not  work directly import it from assets 

5. when writing the jsx: 
- The outer curly braces {} tell JSX you are injecting a JavaScript expression.
- The inner curly braces {} define the JavaScript object containing the styles.

6. INLINE STYLE: In React's JSX, when defining an inline style, you must pass a standard JavaScript object. This means CSS properties are separated by commas, and the values are either numbers or quoted strings, but they should not include semicolons.
